# Tour Guide

Tour Guide is a modern web application designed to provide users with an engaging and interactive experience for exploring guided tours. Built using React, Vite, and Bootstrap, the project focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface and responsive design.

## Features

- **Interactive Tour Listings**: Browse a variety of tours with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using Bootstrap.
- **Modern Development Stack**: Built with React and Vite for a fast and seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Backend support for managing tour data (to be connected).
- **Styling with CSS**: Customized styles for a visually appealing layout.

## Note on Backend Data

Although a backend directory exists in the project, the data is currently being fetched from a static `offers.json` file. Future versions will integrate a fully functional backend API.
